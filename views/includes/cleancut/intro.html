			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The application must integrate with Github or Bitbucket.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">I started the project by creating many sketches about the app to generate ideas about the user flow of the application.</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">First, I designed the "creating test plan and task" flow. The user should able to login using their Github or Bitbucket account, select the application that they want to work with, then start creating the first test plan and tasks associate with the application. The user should also able to add staging or production URL and tags to used for each tasks under Settings. And the user can also see the current progress of the test plan and which browsers are working or failing.</h2>

I started to explore some of the desktop user interface practices from Apple and Invision. Then I played with the color palette and typography. Red, black and white was the chosen color pallete and "Source Sans Pro" was the primary font.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__header">LESSON LEARNED</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__line">This project taught me how to carefully think about the target audience for the application. Muliple users with different goals in mind will use your application so I make sure I design the application that is easy to use by all of our target audience.</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__line">I also learned that even though there is a limited hours that I have per week for the project, I should have done some wireframes. However, since I only work with a small Barbershop team, it is efficient enough to collabrorate and share my ideas without wireframes. It also proves that the design thinking process is very flexible and can repeate as much as we can. It is a very agile process.</h2>
