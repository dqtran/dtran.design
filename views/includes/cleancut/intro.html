		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__info">Barbershop is a creative technology studio based out of Denver, Colorado that focus on building brands and accelerating startups through digital products. I was a Creative Technology Apprentice at <a href="http://www.barbershop.io/" target="_blank"> Barbershop</a>.My project was to create Clencut, an internal Q&A tool. </h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">I started by looking at the project requirements from the Barbershop team. I then did some research about other tools in the market and interviewed few people about their current Q&A process at their firm. This research was based on the app development process of the team and the scope of the project.</h2>

			<li class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The application must integrate with Github or Bitbucket.</li>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">I started the ideation phase by creating many sketches. This helped to generate ideas about the user flow of the application.</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">First, I designed the â€œCreate Test Plan and Task" flow. The user should be able to login using their Github or Bitbucket account, select the application they want to work with, then start creating the first test plan and tasks associate with the application. The user should also be able to add staging or production URL and tags for each tasks under the Settings tab. Finally, the user should be able to see their test plan progress and which browsers worked or failed.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">Second, I worked on the user interface. I wanted users to have access to their test plans and tasks within the application. To achieve this, I explored the user interface of Intercom and ProductHunt.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">Given the limited hours that I had per week for the project, I jumped right into creating high fidelity mockups in order to meet the project milestones. Then I played with the color palette and typography. Red, black and white was the chosen color pallete and "Source Sans Pro" was the primary font. For optimal success, I explored some of the best desktop user interface practices from Apple and Invision.</h2>

The size of the button will also help indicating whether you are adding a release plan, a test plan or a task.

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__header">LESSON LEARNED</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__line">This project taught me how to carefully think about the target audience for the application. Muliple users with different goals use applications differently. I therefore designed the a simple application that anyone in our target audience could use.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__line">I also learned that even though there are limited hours in a week, I could still meet the deadline of major milestones. Since I only worked with the small Barbershop team, I collaborated and share my ideas without wireframes. It proved, to me, that the design thinking process is very flexible and can repeat as much as possible. Design is a very agile process.</h2>
