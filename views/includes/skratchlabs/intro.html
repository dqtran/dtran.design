		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__info">While I was an experience intern at <a href="http://humandesign.agency" target="_blank"> Human Design</a>, my first project is to redesign the blog of <a href="http://www.skratchlabs.com/" target="_blank">Skratch Labs</a>, a Boulder-based company that provides a natural sports-drink supplier aimed at bikers & climbers. They are also offering snacks & cookbooks.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">I started the project by understanding the requirements from the client. Based on the contents that they were having on their blog and contents they were planning to publish, I did a short research on why and how Skratch Labs customers were currently consuming contents on their current blog.</h2>

		<div class="page-content--project-body-alternate__list">
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">Skratch Labs articles are at least 7 minutes read and are the great for education.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">After gathering all the requirements and discovering key insights, I did a short study on other publication platforms from leaders in the industry such as <a href="https://designmind.frogdesign.com/" target="_blank"> Design Mind </a> or <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank"> Medium</a>. Then I narrowed down to the core requirements and features for the project, and defined project goals.</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__header">REQUIREMENTS</h2>
		<div class="page-content--project-body-alternate__list">
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The publication will be hosted on Squarespace. It will provide a simple CMS tool for our clients to easily manage their contents.</h2>
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The articles must be easy to navigated throughout the site and searched from everywhere.</h2>
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The reading and sharing experience are the key to succeed.</h2>

		<div class="page-content--project-body-alternate__asset"> {% include "includes/assets/ideate.html" %} </div>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">Because of the client limited budget and short time frame, I skipped the sketching and wireframing steps. Instead, I jumped right into creating high fidelity mockups with the brand assets and colors from my client.</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">First, I designed the content hierachy. Category contains many articles so the readers will see categories at the first glance. As the user scrolls down, they will see the list of feature articles and lastest artiles.</h2>

		</div>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">Second, I designed the article page. The contents are designed based on the standard of 700px wide which provides the best reading experience. All of the share buttons are located at the top of the page and are sticky.</h2>

		</div>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__line">Finally, I kept iterating on the design all the time until I feel it is good enough before the deadline. The design process is never done until you have to deliver it to the client. I also designed the mobile responsive user interface of the site as well. The final design contains few new features based on more researchs and the feedback from our client. Those features are being highlighted below:</h2>
		<div class="page-content--project-body-alternate__list">
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The progress bar is included and located at the top of the article that will help indicate your current reading progress.</h2>
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The article navigation is added at the top of the sharing buttons to help readers to easily switch to the previous and the next article.</h2>
			<h2 class="page-content--project-body-alternate__insight">The reader can now see the estimation of how long it will take them to read the article.</h2>

		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__header">LESSON LEARNED</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__line">This is the first project that I worked with a client so it is great experience on how to work with them. I learned that you will always have some disagreements with the client even though you have a valid reasons to defend your design and most often, they won't listen to you.</h2>
		<h2 class="page-content--project-body__line">I also learned that even though there is a limited budget and short time frame for the project, I should have done some sketches and wireframes first before jumping into creating high fidelity mockups. It would help me generate more ideas and collaborate with my colleges much faster and more efficient without limiting my thinking and wasting time on creating unused mockups early in the process.</h2>
